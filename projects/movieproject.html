            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p> Me and my partner were assigned to make a movie project about anything we would want for us to practice our HTML, CSS, and planning skills. My partner and I decided to do a comedy and action type theme, to make it entertaining for people to read and be engaged in it. The title of our movie is "Hamster Rumble".

            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p> In our Project we first needed to make a plan on what each of us are going to do, we simply divided the work evenly by having both of us do CSS and HTML to show both of our skills in each category. Furthermore, I had to write the story about how three hamsters were living in harmony, until their long lost brother sneaked into their house and tried to finish all three of them because he got ignored his whole life and was getting treated very poorly when he was younger. Our story is meant to hook the reader into reading the story because of our cliffhangers and action.

             <h2>Reflection</h2>
             <p>Challenges that me and my partner were facing was seeing how to center textboxes because when we viewed our project in fullscreen it was so off centered and had no idea how to center it. We tried multiple solutions by changing the padding or margins px's to see if it would fix the problem. Additionally, we eventually fixed our mistake after playing around with the paddings and margins.
             In addition, when we first started our movie project we had to brainstorm of what kind of movie we are going to make, we first tried seeing on what we had in common but that didnt work out since we had not alot in common, so then I recommended a story on hamsters and she approved of it, she left the story up to me since it was my idea so I really focused on how I am going to make this story that is going to entertain people and make it fun in general. Next time in the future I would try to finish the story faster instead of drawing a blank in my mind and stop procrastinating alot. So I would have more time to double check our code and project overall.</p>
